My name is Carmen Tandadjaja and I am a candidate for a Bachelor's of Science Degree in Computer Information Systems in Pensacola Christian College, Florida.

This is my very first GitHub pages where I will be sharing my achievements and projects I have done through my college career.
There might not be alot to see around here right now but I will try to update the webpage with new contents whenever possible.

Thanks for checking out!
